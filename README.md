This repository represents the deployment of the web application presented through the final degree project "Decision Tree Simulator" for the course "Ingeniería Informática" at the University of Burgos.
The repository is found at [this link](https://github.com/danieldf01/TFG-decision-trees-sim).

The aim of the project has been to build a web application that teaches the concept of decision tree creation algorithms.  
It does so by providing an Entropy calculator, a Conditional Entropy calculator, and a step-by-step visualization of the ID3 algorithm for creating decision trees.

## Description

* Entropy calculator:
  The entropy calculator teaches the concept of entropy (in the context of information theory) to the user by not only providing general information and its formula, but also letting them calculate the entropy for self-chosen values.
* Conditional Entropy calculator:
  Much like the Entropy calculator, the Conditional Entropy calculator teaches the concept of conditional entropy by providing information and the ability to calculate it for a dataset of user-chosen values.
* Step-by-step visualization of the ID3 algorithm:
  This part of the application contains all necessary information about the decision trees and the ID3 algorithm alongside a step-by-step visualization of the creation process of a decision tree.  
  The user is free to choose between different example datasets and using their own example dataset in the CSV file format.
